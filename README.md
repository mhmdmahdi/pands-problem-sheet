# task02 - bmi.py
  Purpose of this task was to write code which can be used to calculate a persons body mass index
  The code takes an input from the user for weight (kg) and height (cm)
  The code then calculate the bmi using the formula for the calculation
  The result is then outputted and printed for the user to see

# task03 - secondstring.py
  Purpose of this task was to take in a string from the user as an input and then output every second letter in reverse order

# task04 - pythoncollatz.py
  Purpose of this was to write a program which takes a postive interger, meaning no negative or zero values should be accepted, and output successive values based on a calculation shown in the code
  I should have written the code to output the values on the same line.
  The method I chose just continues the loop and prints the results. Another method may be to break the loop and print the result on the same line as a result. This may need to define the result as a new variable each time.

# task05 - pythonweekday.py
  This was my first introduction into using methods which helped simplify this code greatly
  Purpose of this assignment was to write code which determines whether or not today is a weekday and outputs the appropriate response as demostrated in the code.

# task06 - squareroot.py
  Purpose of this task was to take a positive floating number as an input and output an approximation of its square root not using the built in code for calculating square roots. This meant using the suggested newton method. 
  For me this assignment was more of a demostration of research abilities rather than coding as none of the code is really my own. I found the code for the newton method online and edited/ manipulated it slightly to suit my needs. This was used in conjunction with the code for creating functions as picked up in this weeks lecture series. 

# task07 - es.py / moby-dick.txt
  For this assignment I created a 'dummy' txt file called moby-dick with a known number of e's.txt which I was reading into the es.py code file.
  The purpose of this task was to read in a text file and count the number of e's in the file taking the filename as an argument from the command line.

# task08 - plottask.py
  Having used matlab in my engineering degree it was great to see it come up again in this course almost a decade later.
  Purpose of this task was to plot functions using matplotlib.
