# task02_bmi.py
# Purpose of this task was to write code which can be used to calculate a persons body mass index
# The code takes an input from the user for weight (kg) and height (cm)
# The code then calculate the bmi using the formula for the calculation
# The result is then outputted and printed for the user to see

# task03_secondstring.py
# Purpose of this task was to take in a string from the user as an input and then output every second letter in reverse order

# task04_pythoncollatz.py
# Purpose of this was to write a program which takes a postive interger, meaning no negative or zero values should be accepted,and output successive values based on a calculation shown in the code
# I should have written the code to output the values on the same line however looking at the code again now weeks later I am a little overwhelmed at the complexity of the if/elif/while statement. Thinking about it now it may be possible to output the values on a single line thorugh some print function if there is one available. The method I have chosen just continues the loop and prints the results. Another method may be to break the loop and print the result on the same line as a result. This may need to define the result as a new variable each time. Would require a bit of thought to perfect this on my part unfortunately.

# task05_pythonweekday.py
# This was my first introduction into using methods which helped simplify this code greatly
# Purpose of this assignment was to write code which determines whether or not today is a weekday and output the appropriate response as demostrated in the code.

# task06_pythonsquareroot.py
# Purpose of this task was to take a positive floating number as an input and output as an approximation of its square root not using the built in code for calculating square roots. This meant using the suggested newton method. 
# For me this assignment was more of a demostration of research abilities rather than coding as none of the code is really my own. I found the code for the newton method online and edited/ manipulated it slightly to suit my needs. This was used in conjunction with the code for creating functions as picked up in this weeks lecture series. 

# task07_pythones.py moby-dick.txt
# For this assignment I created a 'dummy' txt file called moby-dick with a known number of e's.txt which I was reading into the es.py code file.
# The purpose of this task was to read in a text file and count the number of e's in the file taking the filename as an argument from the command line.

# task08_plottask.py
# Having used matlab in my engineering degree it was great to see it come up again in this course almost a decade later.
# Purpose of this task was to plot functions using matplotlib.
# Importing 'numpy' and 'matplotlib' did show some difficulty however this was eventually resolved after much googling. 
# I didn't expect to see matlab used in python at all and was really impressed to see just how powerful python is. Throughout this course we got insights into this not only because it is affiliated with matlab but also because we touched off its affiliation with excel/ csv - all program I have used before and am excited to use again but in an improved way.
